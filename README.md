# Code-Quiz Project - Javascript

## This program generates a 5 question multiple choice quiz. All questions are selected randomly from a pool of available questions. Questions do not appear in the same order each time the application is run.

## A timer is set once the quiz starts and every time you miss a question a specific amount (FILL THIS HERE) of time is reduced from the timer.

## Once you have finished all the questions or the timer reaches zero, the game ends.

## Once the quiz ends, you are given the opportunity to record your score into a "high scores" list. The score is the amount of time that was left when the quiz ended.

## Here is a link for the application: ![]https://forbegos.github.io/Code-Quiz/
